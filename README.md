## Final Project – Dessert Showcase
**Assignment Goal:**
Create a final project that incorporates many of the techniques learned throughout the course. Must include all required features given and at least 3 secondary features. The purpose of this final project was to create a highly polished app that we have a personal interest in.

**My Approach:**
For my final project, I chose to develop a mobile app called **Dessert Showcase**. This app allows users to search for and favorite desserts from various countries. When a dessert is selected, users can view a brief history, access its recipe, and add it to their favorites. A soft chime plays each time a dessert is liked or unliked, enhancing the user experience with subtle audio feedback.

The required features to include were a local database, multiple pages, ListView, and Images. The 3 secondary features I chose were meaningful user preferences, layout changes based on phone vs tablet or portrait vs landscape, and sound.
